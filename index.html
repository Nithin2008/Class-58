           <h1> My favoroite hobby is playing piano
    </h1>
    <p>Regular piano playing offers different physical and physiological advantages to players. It sharpens fine motor skills, improves dexterity and hand-eye co-ordination. Playing piano is my favorite. I go to piano classes and I even play classical music in piano.

           <h1>Mozart is one of my inspirations
    </h1>
           <p>
               Born in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty, embarking on a grand tour. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position.
